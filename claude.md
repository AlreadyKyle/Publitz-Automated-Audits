## 👤 User Preferences (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)

**Kyle is a non-technical user. Always optimize for ease of use:**

1. **GitHub Desktop over Terminal**
   - Always provide GitHub Desktop instructions when possible
   - Only use terminal commands as a last resort
   - Assume Kyle uses GitHub Desktop on Mac

2. **Simplicity First**
   - Make everything double-click friendly
   - Create `.command` files for Mac that open Terminal automatically
   - No complex terminal workflows

3. **Non-Coder Friendly**
   - Use plain English, not technical jargon
   - Explain what things do, not how they work
   - Focus on "what to click" not "what to run"

4. **Don't Break Things**
   - Only make usability improvements that don't introduce bugs
   - Test changes before suggesting them
   - Keep the system working while making it easier

5. **DO IT, DON'T INSTRUCT** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
   - If you CAN fix something directly, DO IT
   - Don't give instructions when you can make the change yourself
   - Don't ask Kyle to edit files when you have edit tools
   - Don't create back-and-forth when you can solve it in one go
   - **Plan fully → Execute completely → Deliver working solution**

6. **Systematic Problem Solving**
   - When Kyle reports a problem, create a complete plan first
   - Fix ALL related issues in one comprehensive update
   - Test your changes before committing
   - Don't make piecemeal updates that require multiple rounds
   - Think through the entire workflow, not just the immediate issue

**When updating this repo, always ask: "Could Kyle do this without touching terminal?" AND "Can I fix this myself instead of asking Kyle?"**

## 🏗️ Architecture

### The 4-Input System

All client data comes from a folder: `inputs/<client-name>/`

1. **steam_url.txt** - Single line with Steam store URL
   ```
   https://store.steampowered.com/app/12345/Game_Name/
   ```

2. **competitors.txt** - List of competitor games (5-10)
   ```
   Hades
   Dead Cells
   The Binding of Isaac
   ```

3. **intake_form.json** - Client metadata
   ```json
   {
     "client_name": "Awesome Studio",
     "game_name": "My Game",
     "launch_date": "2025-03-15",
     "target_price": 19.99,
     "team_size": 3,
     "main_concerns": "Pricing, visibility, timing"
   }
   ```

4. **strategy_notes.txt** - Free-form strategy call notes
   ```
   Strategy Call Notes - Jan 5, 2025

   Client Emotional State: Anxious but motivated

   Key Concerns:
   - Worried about capsule visibility

## 🎨 The Report Structure

### 9 Comprehensive Sections

1. **Cover Page** - Game name, client, readiness badge
2. **Executive Summary** - Star ratings, top 3 actions, key insights
3. **Compliance Audit** - Steam page checklist
4. **Store Page Optimization** - Capsule, description, tags, screenshots (USES VISION!)
5. **Regional Pricing Strategy** - Price analysis & tables
6. **Competitive Analysis** - Detailed competitor breakdown
7. **Launch Timing Analysis** - Window assessment & conflicts
8. **Implementation Roadmap** - Week-by-week action plan
9. **First-Year Sales Strategy** - Discount calendar & bundle strategy

### Star Rating System

- ⭐ **Store Quality** (1-5): Technical + visual + content
- ⭐ **Competitive Position** (1-5): Price + differentiation + market fit
- ⭐ **Launch Timing** (1-5): Window + calendar + prep time

**Overall Tiers**:
- ✅ LAUNCH READY: Mostly 4-5 stars
- ⚠️ LAUNCH VIABLE: Mix of 3-5 stars
- 🚨 HIGH RISK: Multiple 2-3 stars
- ❌ NOT READY: Any 1-star

## 🔍 Claude Vision Integration (NEW!)

### What It Analyzes

1. **Capsule/Header Image**:
   - Readability at thumbnail size (460x215px)
   - Logo sizing (120px+ recommended)
   - Contrast and visibility
   - Visual hierarchy
   - Genre appropriateness

2. **Screenshots** (up to 3):
   - UI clarity and readability
   - Visual quality / production value
   - Gameplay communication
   - Action/interest level
   - Technical issues

3. **Banner/Background**:
   - Visual impact
   - Branding consistency
   - Text readability
   - Composition

### How It Works

```python
# In report_generator.py:

1. _fetch_image_as_base64(url)
   - Downloads image from Steam CDN
   - Converts to base64 data URI

2. _analyze_visual_asset(url, type, context)
   - Calls Claude Vision API
   - Asset-specific analysis prompts
   - Returns detailed critique

3. _analyze_all_visual_assets(data, inputs)
   - Orchestrates all vision analysis
   - Caches results
   - Returns structured analysis dict

4. In generate_full_report():
   - Calls vision analysis BEFORE building prompt
   - Integrates results into prompt
   - Claude uses vision feedback in Section 2
```

### Benefits

- **Specific measurements**: "Logo is 60px, needs 120px" not "make logo bigger"
- **Professional critique**: Worth $200-300 standalone
- **Catches thumbnail issues**: What humans miss at small size
- **Genre-aware**: Compares to successful games in genre

### Cost Impact

- Adds ~$2-3 per report (4-5 images analyzed)
- Adds ~30-60 seconds to generation time
- **Total cost**: ~$5-8 per report (still <1% of $800 value)

## 💻 How to Use (Production Workflow)

### For Each New Client

#### 1. Create Client Folder
```bash
python generate_audit.py --create-example client-name
```

This creates: `inputs/client-name/` with template files.

#### 2. Fill in Client Data

Edit the 4 files in `inputs/client-name/`:
- `steam_url.txt` - Get from client
- `competitors.txt` - Client provides or you research
- `intake_form.json` - From intake form
- `strategy_notes.txt` - Notes from strategy call

#### 3. Generate Report
```bash
python generate_audit.py --client client-name
```

**Wait 5-8 minutes**. The system will:
1. ✅ Validate inputs
2. ✅ Collect Steam data
3. ✅ Analyze competitors
4. ✅ Run external research
5. ✅ Analyze visuals with Claude Vision (NEW!)
6. ✅ Generate 35-45 page report with Claude AI
7. ✅ Save markdown to `output/client-name/`

#### 4. Review & Deliver (Phase 3 - Coming Soon)
```bash
# Will generate PDF automatically
ls output/client-name/
# → client-name_audit_20251209.pdf
```

## 🛠️ Development Best Practices

### When Working on This Project

1. **Always Read Documentation First**
   - `REDESIGN_PLAN.md` - Complete architecture & design decisions
   - `PHASE1_COMPLETE.md` & `PHASE2_COMPLETE.md` - What's built
   - This file (`claude.md`) - Current context

2. **Maintain Simplicity**
   - Core principle: 4 inputs → PDF report
   - Don't over-engineer
   - If feature doesn't improve deliverable, skip it

3. **Focus on Report Quality**
   - Specific recommendations (measurements, steps, time estimates)
   - No generic advice ("improve capsule" ❌ → "increase logo to 120px" ✅)
   - Vision analysis should enhance, not replace, expert analysis

4. **Test with Real Data**
   - Use actual Steam games
   - Check API responses
   - Validate vision analysis quality

5. **Document Everything**
   - Update PHASE docs when completing phases
   - Keep this file current
   - Explain design decisions

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Current branch
git branch
# → claude/design-customer-docs-013AU6obijhzjV9JkhWxqose

- Small cost increase (~$2-3) for huge value

### Why Markdown First, PDF Later?
- Easier to review/edit
- Git-friendly
- Phase 3 will add beautiful PDF
- Clients can still read markdown

---

## 📞 Common Issues & Solutions

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set"
```bash
# Create .env file in project root
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here" > .env
```

### "No module named 'anthropic'"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Vision analysis failing
