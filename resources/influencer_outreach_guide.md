## The Outreach Process

### Phase 1: Research (1-2 weeks)

**Build Your Target List:**
1. Watch creators in your genre
2. Note their content style
3. Check their communication preferences
4. Verify they cover indie games
5. Look for business email/contact form

**Red Flags:**

- Only does sponsored content
- Inactive channel (no uploads in 3+ months)
- Wrong genre/audience
- No business contact info

**Green Lights:**
- Regularly features indie games
- Engages with developers
- Clear contact method
- Active community
- Recent uploads

### Phase 2: Preparation (1 week)

**Materials Needed:**
- Steam keys (generate extras)
- Press kit (screenshots, trailer, key art)
- One-page fact sheet
- Personal pitch (customized per creator)
- Demo build (if game isn't finished)

**Press Kit Must-Haves:**
- Game logo (PNG with transparency)
- 10+ high-res screenshots

- B-roll footage (optional but helpful)

### Phase 3: Initial Outreach

**Email Structure:**

```
Subject: [Game Name] - [Genre] Key Offer

Hi [Name],

[Personal note about their channel - 1-2 sentences showing you actually watch them]

[Brief pitch - 2-3 sentences max]

[Sign off]
```

**DO:**
✅ Personalize every email

✅ Offer no-strings-attached key

**DON'T:**
❌ Mass CC everyone

❌ Send on Monday morning
❌ Be pushy about timeline

**Best Times to Send:**
- Tuesday-Thursday
- 10 AM - 2 PM (their timezone)
- Avoid Mondays (inbox overload)
- Avoid Fridays (weekend plans)

### Phase 4: Follow-Up

**Timeline:**
- Wait 7-10 days after initial email
- Send ONE follow-up
- Keep it brief
- Assume they're busy
- Give easy out

**Follow-Up Template:**

```
Subject: Re: [Game Name]

Hi [Name],

Totally understand if you're busy or it's not a fit! Just wanted to make sure it didn't get lost.

Still happy to send a key if you're interested.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**After Follow-Up:**

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics

**Traffic:**
- Steam page visits during/after coverage
- Use UTM codes for tracking
- Compare to baseline traffic

**Wishlists:**
- Spike during coverage period
- Conversion rate (views → wishlists)
- Retention (do they stay on list?)

**Sales:**
- Direct sales during coverage
- Long-tail sales from discovery
- Wishlist → purchase conversion

**Community:**
- Discord joins
- Social media follows
- Community Hub activity

### ROI Calculation

**For Free Coverage:**
```
ROI = (Revenue from coverage) / (Time invested)
Time invested = Research + Outreach + Management
```

**For Paid Sponsorships:**
```
ROI = (Revenue from coverage - Cost) / Cost × 100
Break-even = Cost / Average Revenue Per User
```

**Example:**
- Sponsorship cost: $500
- Average game price: $20
- Sales from coverage: 50
- Revenue: $1000
- ROI: ($1000 - $500) / $500 = 100%
