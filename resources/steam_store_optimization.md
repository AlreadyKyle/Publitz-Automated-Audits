# Steam Store Page Optimization Guide

## Essential Elements of a High-Converting Steam Page

### 1. Capsule Image (460x215)
Your capsule image is the #1 most important asset. It appears in:
- Browse pages
- Search results
- Wishlist emails
- Featured sections

**Best Practices:**
- Show gameplay, not just art
- Include readable game title
- Use high contrast
- Test at small sizes
- Avoid clutter
- No tiny text

**Common Mistakes:**
❌ Title too small to read
❌ Too much information
❌ Generic art that doesn't show gameplay
❌ Poor contrast

### 2. Screenshots (Minimum 5, Recommended 10+)
Screenshots are viewed by 90% of visitors.

**Optimal Order:**
1. **Hero shot** - Best visual moment
2. **Core gameplay** - What you actually do
3. **Unique mechanic** - What makes it different
4. **Environment variety** - Show different areas
5. **UI/Systems** - Show progression/systems
6-10. More gameplay variety

**Tips:**
- Hide UI for screenshots 1-3
- Show UI for screenshots 4-5
- Use 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080)
- Avoid cluttered moments
- Compress properly (under 5MB each)

### 3. Trailer (First 30 seconds are critical)
- **0-5 seconds:** Hook - Best moment
- **5-15 seconds:** Gameplay loop
- **15-30 seconds:** Unique features
- **30-60 seconds:** More gameplay
- **60-90 seconds:** Release date/wishlisting

**Trailer Checklist:**
✅ Starts with action, not logos
✅ Shows actual gameplay
✅ Has clear audio
✅ Includes readable text
✅ Ends with call-to-action
✅ Under 2 minutes

### 4. Description
Structure your description like this:

#### Short Description (300 characters)
- One sentence hook
- What is it?
- What makes it unique?

#### Full Description
**Section 1: Hook (First 2-3 lines)**
Appears "above the fold" - make it count!

**Section 2: Key Features (Bullet points)**
- 5-8 bullet points
- Focus on player benefits, not features
- Use action verbs
- Be specific

**Section 3: Story/Setting (Optional)**
Brief context if relevant

**Section 4: Game Modes**
Single-player, co-op, multiplayer details

**Section 5: Call to Action**
- Wishlist reminder
- Social media links
- Discord invite

### 5. Tags (Up to 20)
Tags affect discoverability in search and browse.

**Tag Strategy:**
- Use all 20 slots
- Start with genre tags
- Add specific mechanic tags
- Include aesthetic tags
- Add audience tags

**Example for Roguelike:**
1. Roguelike
2. Roguelite
3. Procedural Generation
4. Pixel Art
5. Action
6. Dungeon Crawler
7. Difficult
8. Replayability
9. Permadeath
10. Character Customization
(continue to 20)

### 6. System Requirements
Be honest but don't oversell.

**Minimum Specs:**
- What actually runs the game at 30fps low settings
- Common 5+ year old hardware

**Recommended Specs:**
- 60fps at high settings
- Modern mid-range hardware

### 7. Localization

- German (8%)
- Spanish (7%)
- French (6%)

**Tier 2 Priority:**
- Russian (9%)
- Portuguese-Brazil (6%)
- Japanese (10%)

**Localization Levels:**
