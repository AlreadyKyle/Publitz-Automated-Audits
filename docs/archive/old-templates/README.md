# Old PDF Templates Archive

**Archived**: December 9, 2025

These are template PDFs from the old Streamlit-based audit system (pre-December 2025).

## What's Here

13 template PDFs including:
- Pre-Launch templates (intake, process, reports)
- Post-Launch templates (delivery, prompts, review responses)
- Regional pricing templates
- Client tracker templates

## Why Archived

The system was redesigned in December 2025 from a complex Streamlit app to a simple 4-input → PDF system. These templates are no longer used but kept for historical reference.

## Current System

The new system uses:
- 4 simple `.command` files (double-click to run)
- Automated PDF generation via Claude AI
- No manual templates needed

See `USER_GUIDE.md` in the root directory for current usage.
