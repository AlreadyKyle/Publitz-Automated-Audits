# Archive - Old Documentation

**Archived Date**: December 9, 2025

This directory contains documentation from the **old Streamlit-based system** and various iterations before the redesign. These files are kept for historical reference but are **no longer relevant** to the current system.

---

## Current System (Redesigned)

The system was completely redesigned on December 9, 2025 to be a **simple 4-input → PDF system**.

**For current documentation, see the root directory:**
- `README.md` - Main system overview
- `README_NEW_SYSTEM.md` - New system details
- `WORKFLOW.md` - Production workflow
- `API_INTEGRATION_README.md` - How to run with new APIs
- `ENHANCEMENTS.md` - All enhancements and features
- `claude.md` - Project context

---

## What Was Archived

### Old System Files
- **Streamlit Deployment Docs** - Old web app deployment guides
- **API Configuration Docs** - Old API setup (replaced by new system)
- **Bug Fix Reports** - Old system bugs (no longer relevant)
- **Deployment Guides** - Old deployment procedures

### Outdated Documentation
- **Old architecture docs** - Replaced by simplified design
- **Old scoring systems** - Replaced by simplified audit
- **Old examples** - Replaced by new system examples
- **Old status reports** - Historical tracking

### Why Archived

These documents described the **old complex Streamlit system** with:
- Multi-page web interface
- Complex scoring algorithms
- Multiple data sources
- Deployment infrastructure

**Current system** is much simpler:
- 4 input files (text/JSON)
- Single CLI command
- Direct PDF output
- No deployment needed

## Migration Notes

**From Old System → New System**:

| Old System | New System |
|------------|------------|
| Streamlit web app | CLI command |
| Multiple input pages | 4 simple files |
| Complex scoring | Simplified audit |
| Deployment infrastructure | Direct execution |
| ~50 files | ~15 core files |

**Data preserved**:
- Core audit methodology
- Research insights
- Best practices
- Client workflow patterns

**Removed complexity**:
- Web interface overhead
- Deployment complexity
- Multi-tier scoring
- Complex data flows

---

## When to Reference Archive

**Use archive docs if**:
- Need to understand old system decisions
- Migrating data from old format
- Historical reference for research
- Understanding evolution of methodology

**Don't use archive docs for**:
- Current system operations
- New client onboarding
- Production workflows
- Feature development

---

## Archive Policy

**Keep**:
- Historical reference
- Research insights that informed current system
- Evolution documentation

**Don't restore**:
- Old deployment procedures
- Outdated configuration
- Old bug reports
- Obsolete architecture
